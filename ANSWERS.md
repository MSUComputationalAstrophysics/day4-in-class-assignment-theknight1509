The difference between relative change in history between Euler, EulerCromer and
the RungeKutta4 method can be viewed in 'relative_error.png'.

For these three methods to reach a relative error of 10^-4 or better is:
dt = 2*10^-6 for RK4
dt = 2*10^-2 for EC
dt = 7*10^-4 for Euler
dt = 10^-2 for midpoint
dt = 10^-1 for PC
